You will need at least two terminals to run HW#4: one for the server, and one for the client+shell. If you run more clients, you will need more terminals

1. Running the server (first terminal)

First, run the block server. It will take three arguments:
-port : port number in which the server listens (e.g. 8000)
-nb : number of blocks (must match the client, e.g. 256)
-bs : block size (must also match the client, e.g. 128)

run it as follows:

python3 memoryfs_server.py -p 8000 -nb 512 -bs 256
python3 memoryfs_server.py -p 8001 -nb 512 -bs 256
python3 memoryfs_server.py -p 8002 -nb 512 -bs 256
python3 memoryfs_server.py -p 8003 -nb 512 -bs 256


2. Running the client+shell (second terminal)

It takes the file system configuration arguments from previous assignments (e.g. -nb, -bs, -is, -ni) plus two new arguments:
-cid : a unique client ID (e.g. 0)
-port : port number of the server (must match the one above, e.g. 8000)

run it as follows:

python3 memoryfs_shell_rpc.py -nb 1536 -bs 256 -ns 4 -startport 8000 -cid 0 -is 32

The shell commands work as in previous assignments.


3. Examples running different configurations and multiple clients

Suppose you want to run a larger file system and two clients (cid 0 and 1):

python3 memoryfs_server.py -p 8000 -nb 2048 -bs 512

python3 memoryfs_shell_rpc.py -nb 2048 -bs 512 -is 32 -ni 128 -cid 0 -port 8000
python3 memoryfs_shell_rpc.py -nb 2048 -bs 512 -is 32 -ni 128 -cid 1 -port 8000


4. Terminating client and server

You can quit the client with the exit command
For the server, in its terminal, type CTRL+C to exit
